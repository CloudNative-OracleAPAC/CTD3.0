## Lab 1: Hands On CafeSupremo Bot ##

### Introduction ###
The CafeSupremo Bot is designed to attract new customers and to allow current customers to have a more personal interaction with the brand.  In this instance a prospective customer (Lucy) is walking down the street and has a desire for a cup of coffee.

By simply searching for Café Supremo in Facebook Messenger, Lucy is able to access their CoffeeBot and quickly order the beverage she is after, and have it ready by the time she reaches the nearest Coffee Shop.

In this Lab, you will be accessing the bot to similarly order a coffee from CafeSupremo; Firstly as a prospective/new customer, then subsequently acting as a repeat and/or more knowledgeable customer of the brand.

You will see how the bot is able to interact with you as a customer, then as it learns from your past orders, how it can tailor the questions to optimise the interaction.

### Prerequisite ###

Where Facebook is available, the CafeSupremo Bot will be accessed via the Facebook Messenger app, and as such each attendee will require a Facebook Account for accessing the "Out of the Box" Bot.

As the Facebook app (and hence the bot) is not “Public”, to access the Bot you will need to have your Facebook ID registered with the Facebook App itself (as a “tester” of the app/page).  As such, you will need to make sure that your facilitator has this information prior to starting the Lab exercises. 

To find your Facebook ID (as opposed to your Login Name), login to your Facebook account and click on your Avatar | name in the page header - this will take you to your profile page.

Your Facebook ID is indicated in the URL of the page ``https://www.facebook.com/[your facebook ID]``

### Order a Coffee with the Café Supremo Coffee Bot.###

**Your instructor will give you details on accessing the bot.**

**NOTE:** As indicated in the prerequisites above, to access the Bot via Facebook Messenger, you will need to have given your Facebook ID to the Test Drive Moderator prior to this exercise in order to be registered as a "Tester" within the Facebook App.

## The Customer gives sufficient information in their initial request ##
Rather than have the CoffeeBot ask a lot of questions as in Scenario #1, you can give various levels of information in the initial request/statement and the bot will avoid asking redundant questions.  (Try different versions of the initial request after the hello)

- **``"I want a large double shot soy latte to take away. I'll do a cash pick up at the Union Square cafe in about 10 Minutes"``**
<img src="img/lab1-3-3-1.png" width="75%"/>

- **Write your name.**
<img src="img/lab1-3-3-2.png" width="75%"/>

- **``"No"``**
- **``"Thanks for the help!"``**
