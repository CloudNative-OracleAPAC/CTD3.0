## Lab 6: Exposing the Bot in a Social Messaging Channel (Facebook) ##

### Introduction ###

End users have a wide choice of messaging channels they may prefer to use, and in fact different demographics (age of the user, geography etc) have centralized on specific channels as their preferred messaging platform (such as Telegram being popular with a younger generation or WeChat being dominant with the Chinese user base).

There are different categories of channels as well, and broadly speaking, these can be categorized as follows: 
 - 3rd party Social Chat Channels (such as Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Line etc.)
 - Embedded Chat interfaces â€“ extending current mobile and web apps to contain chat capabilities.
 - Virtual Assistants  -  (such as Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, Amazon Echo, Google Home etc.)  In this category, the use of voice input has become the common approach to interaction.
 
The Oracle Intelligent Bot Platform supports the use of current (and future) conversational channels by abstracting away the channel client, providing out of the box integration to these channels (through the use of a standard Webhook standard interfaces).

In this Lab you will be integrating the Digital Assistant Skill created in the previous Labs into Facebook Messenger.  This requires the following Steps.
 - Creating a Page in Facebook to receive the incoming messages from Facebook Messenger.
 - Creating A Facebook App to redirect the Messages to the Oracle Digital Assistant.
 - Wire Facebook and the Digital Assistant together through the registration of each platform with the other, via the use of their Webhook addresses.

### Step1 ###

**NOTE:** Facebook has a habit of changing the layout of its pages in the Developer Portal.  As such, some of the screen shots in these notes may no longer be accurate.  If so please use the notes a concept guide and/or ask your instructor if you cannot find the function in the Developer Portal.

1. Login into your Facebook account and create a new page from the dropdown menu at the top right of your home page.

2. Select the type of Facebook page you want by selecting one of the options, for example "Company, Organization or Institution".

<img src="img/lab6-1-2a.png" width="50%"/>

Choose the Company, Organisation or Intitution Tile and fill in the name (while not mandatory, use the same name as the Bot you created earlier)

<img src="img/lab6-1-2b.png" width="30%"/>

3. You will need to configure your Facebook account as a "Facebook Developer Account".

Go to **https://developers.facebook.com** and in the resulting page select the Register button.

<img src="img/lab6-1-3a.png" width="75%"/>

If you're already a registered Facebook developer, then you'll be logged in and are ready to create an app.

Once Registered you will want to add a new Facebook App

<img src="img/lab6-1-3b.png" width="50%"/>


4. In the Create a New App ID dialog enter the name **``MyCafeSupremo_TD_{YOUR INITIALS>}``** and then select a Category (Retail). The app will represent your chatbot in Facebook. Also supply a contact email address then click the Create App ID button. The name of this Facebook App is not yet connected to the name of your ChatBot. You will connect your ChatBot and the Facebook App in later steps.

<img src="img/lab6-1-4.png" width="50%"/>

5. The resulting page is the Facebook App dashboard for configuring your application. By default this typically takes you to the product page to add various products to your application. A product represents a service that Facebook provides. To support our bot, we will need to enable the Messenger product and Webhook product for the page we just created.

6. Select the Dashboard menu option in the left options. This shows you the top level information about your application of which the App Secret key will be needed for Intelligent Bot. Select the Show button in the App Secret field...

<img src="img/lab6-1-6a.png" width="75%"/>

then copy down the App Secret key and you will use this shortly. You will have to provide your Facebook password to
view the key. Copy this value into a text editor for later.

<img src="img/lab6-1-6b.png" width="75%"/>

7. Click on the [Add Product] button on the left so we can add the Messenger product. From the resulting list select **Messenger** item in the list.

<img src="img/lab6-1-7.png" width="50%"/>

8. In the Messenger settings page create a Page Access Token to identify the Facebook page, (that you created earlier), to which messages are sent from your Intelligent Bot. 

Scroll down to the Token Generation section, in the Page drop down select your page. In doing this Facebook will now generate a
Page Access Token. Copy this value into a text editor for later use.

### Step 2 ###
**Setup the Digital Assistant to use the Facebook Channel**

1. Go back to the Digital Assistant Builder and expand **``Development V``** section within the main menu and select the **``Channels``** submenu item

<img src="img/lab6-2-1.png" width="100%"/>

2. Click on the `[+ Channel]` button (under the **``users``** tab if not already selected)

<img src="img/lab6-2-2.png" width="50%"/>

3. In the Create Channel dialog, give the channel a Name and Description

<img src="img/lab6-2-3.png" width="50%"/>

<table width="50%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>Name:</td>
    <td>CafeSupremo_FB_[YOUR INITIALS]</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Description:</td>
    <td>Webhook Channel to expose the Digital Assistant within Facebook Messenger</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Channel Type:</td>
    <td>Facebook</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Page Access Token:</td>
    <td>Value copied from the Facebook Webhook definition above</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>App Secret:</td>
    <td>Value copied from the Facebook Settings Page above</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<img src="img/lab6-2-5.png" width="50%"/>

4. Click the **[Create]** button.

5. Select your newly created channel from the list of defined Channels

- Toggle the **``Channel Enabled``** switch to **ON** and copy the **Verify Token** and **Webhook URL** values into a Text Editor. These will be used later in the Facebook Developer UI to define the callback Webhooks used to wire the Facebook App to your Digital Assistant Skill.

<img src="img/lab6-2-6.png" width="50%"/>

> **Note:** If you are not using an Oracle Public Cloud instance for the Test Drive (such as the use of a hosted Docker Image), you will need to expose the Digital Assistant to the Internet. For this exercise we will be using the ngrok service to give us an externally accessible URL.  (The value for external URL will be given to you by your instructor).<br><br> Eg. ```https://db8e9999.ngrok.io/```<br><br>Replace the Base URL in the Webhook URL that you copied down with the **ngrok** entry point.<br>Hence,<br><br>```http://bots-connectors:8000/connectors/v1/tenants/botslc01ga/listeners/facebook/channels/...```<br><br>becomes<br><br>```https://db8e9999.ngrok.io/connectors/v1/tenants/botslc01ga/listeners/facebook/channels/...```

6. Specify for which Bot it will be associated, by selecting your *Skill* from the *Pop-List* on the **``Route To:``** field.

### Step 3 ###
**Register the Digital Assistant Webhook Callback URL with the Facebook Channel**

1. Return to the Facebook App screen in your other browser tab. 

Select the Messenger option in the list of Products on the left hand side, followed by the **[Setup Webhooks]** button of the Webhooks section.

7. In the resulting New Page Subscription dialog 
- copy the **Webhook URL** you wrote down from the Digital Assistant channel into the **``Callback URL``** field
- copy the **Verify Token** value from the Digital Assistant channel into the **``Verify Token``** Field. 

In the Subscription Fields options, select the following:
- Messages
- Message_postbacks

<img src="img/lab6-3-2.png" width="75%"/>

Click **``[Verify and Save]``**

If the verification is not successful, check the URL isvalid (with the correct ngrok entry) as well as the correct Verification token. 

8. In the updated Messenger Settings page, under the **Select a Page** dropdown, select the name of the page you created earlier then select
the Subscribe button.

<img src="img/lab6-3-3.png" width="75%"/>

9. Test the Bot in Facebook by going back to your page and clicking the **Test Button** option from the dropdown shown hovering over the [Send Message] button that is at the top of the page.
